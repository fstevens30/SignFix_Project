# SignFix Calculator
## A simple calculator to determine lengths and sizes of SignFix needed when making a sign.

- The aim of this application is for signmakers to input the length and height of the sign they are making. It will then output how many pieces of channel are needed and what lengths are required. This will avoid confusion and guess-work when making non-standard signs. 

- Here is an example image of the signs that this program works for, note the varying sizes;

- Program can be altered to allow for differing rule-sets between manufacturers, the original only focuses on the specifications givin by SignFix (linked below).
